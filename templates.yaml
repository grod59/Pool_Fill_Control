help: |
    Dad designed me to help you determine if you can go swimming without having to get in the water
    first. All you need to do is tell me what temperature you like your pool water and I will
    tell you if it is ok to swim. So, please tell me ... What temperature do you like your pool water?


too_cold: |
        NO! Don't go swimming..... Since you like your pool water at {{temperature}} and the pool is actually at {{pool_current_temp}},
        you might not want to go swimming right now because it is too cold!

just_right: |
        Yes! Let's go swimming..... Since you like your pool water at {{temperature}} and the pool is actually at {{pool_current_temp}},
        now is the perfect time to go swimming!
